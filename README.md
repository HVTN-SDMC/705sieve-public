## Genotypic Sieve Analysis in the HVTN 705/HPX2008 Imbokodo Trial
*R* code implementing data analyses that generated figures and tables in the manuscript Juraska, Li et al., Quantifying how a Mosaic HIV-1 Vaccine Regimenâ€™s Efficacy Depends on Envelope Sequence Features in the HVTN 705/HPX2008 Imbokodo Trial.

    + sievePH 1.0.3
    + lunnMcneil.R
    + p.adj.perm2.R
    + common.R
    
* `code/2_sieveBinary/sieveBinaryMain.R`: summarizes sieve analyses for binary features of Env amino acid sequences
    + tidyverse 2.0.0
    + plyr 1.8.9
    + grid 4.4.1
    + gridExtra 2.3
    + gtable 0.3.5

    + tidyverse 2.0.0
    + sievePH 1.0.3
    + ggplot.summary.sievePH.R
    + common.R

* `code/4_multiseq/multiseq_heatmaps.R`: generates heatmaps in Figures S14 and S15 based on multiple sequences per participant
    + tidyverse 2.0.0
    + ggpubr 0.6.0
    + scales 1.3.0
    + DT 0.33.3

### 2. Installation Guide
  
* Install required version of *R*.  
* Install required *R* packages.  
* Clone this repository.
  
### 3. User Instructions

  Each code file should run in less than 2 minutes except `code/1_westfallYoung/sieveWestfallYoungPermPvals.R` which 
  takes approximately 1 day to run.  Output is saved as either a figure (a `.pdf` file in the `figures` directory) or 
  a table (a `.csv` file in the `tables` directory).
  
  From the command line, starting in the `code` directory, run the following commands:

    R CMD BATCH 0_preScreen/screenMain.R &
    R CMD BATCH 1_westfallYoung/sieveWestfallYoungPermPvals.R &
    R CMD BATCH 2_sieveBinary/sieveBinaryMain.R &
    R CMD BATCH 3_sievePH/VEbyHammingDist.R &
    R CMD BATCH 3_sievePH/VEbyOtherQuantMarks.R
